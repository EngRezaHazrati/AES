# AES
Implementation of AES-128
To run the program you need to have numpy library.
Besides if you want to run the program, it is just required
to go to run the file named "aesMain.py".
Let's suppose you are using python3.11 then you should run the command below:
python3.11 ./aesMain.py

The program contains two part, Encryption and Decryption.
After running the program, it will ask you if you want to Encrypt or Decrypt.
If you want to Encrypt it is just required to enter the PLAIN-TEXT and the KEY,
and if you want to Decrypt, it is just required to enter the CIPHER-TEXT and the KEY.

Hope you enjoy the program and it becomes helpful.
